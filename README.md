# bill-analysis

The intent of this project is to provide an unbiased source on political issues to the public. Spepcifically, this code focuses on mapping bills to complex issues and determining a bill's support for subtopics within the issue.

## Research Project Progress

So far, this research project involves 3 attempts at understanding bill recognition methods:

1. LDA Topic Modeling
2. Automatic Text Summarization
3. Language Recognition

The project mainly focuses on the 3rd approach, language recognition, which searches a bill text for relevant sentences and words, and gives a bill a score for each topic with 0 as no support and 1 as full support for the topic. 

All code is written in Python. 

### Getting Started

To follow the project's entire work, click on the LDA folder to access the code and findings, then do the same with Automatic Text Summarization and Language Recognition folders. For current work, proceed to the Language Recognition folder.
