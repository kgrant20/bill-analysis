SEC. 103. GUIDANCE.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Attorney General, in coordination with the 
Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and State and local law 
enforcement agencies, shall issue guidance on best practices relating 
to establishing standard data collection systems that capture the 
information required to be reported under subsections (h) and (i) of 
section 501 of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets 
Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10152), as added by sections 101 and 102 of this 
Act, respectively, and that ensure the reporting under such subsections 
(h) and (i) is consistent with data reported under the Death in Custody 
Reporting Act of 2013 (34 U.S.C. 60105 et seq.), section 20104(a)(2) of 
the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (34 U.S.C.

for terms, including the term ``use of force''.
    (b) Privacy Protections.--Nothing in section 101 or 102 shall be 
construed to supersede the requirements or limitations under section 
552a of title 5, United States Code (commonly known as the ``Privacy 
Act of 1974'').

SEC. 104. COMPLIANCE ASSISTANCE GRANTS.

    (a) In General.--The Attorney General may award grants to States 
and units of local government to assist in the collection of the 
information required to be reported under subsections (h) and (i) of 
section 501 of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets 
Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10152), as added by sections 101 and 102 of this

SEC. 105. INCENTIVIZING BANNING OF CHOKEHOLDS.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) chokeholds are extremely dangerous maneuvers that can 
        easily result in serious bodily injury or death;
            (2) George Floyd's death has become a flashpoint to compel 
        the need to address the use of chokeholds by law enforcement 
        officers across the United States;
            (3) the National Consensus Policy on Use of Force, a 
        collaborative effort among 11 of the most significant law 
        enforcement leadership and labor organizations in the United 
        States, concluded in a discussion paper on the use of force 
        that chokeholds are extremely dangerous and recommended 
        restricting their use, consistent with this section; and
            (4) law enforcement agencies throughout the United States 
        must create policies that guard against the use of this 
        maneuver to help prevent the death of civilians whom they 
        encounter, and engender more trust and faith among law 
        enforcement officers and the communities they serve.
    (b) Incentivizing Banning of Chokeholds.--
            (1) COPS grant program eligibility.--Section 1701 of title 
        I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 
        U.S.C. 10381), as amended by section 601 of this Act, is 
        amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(o) Banning of Chokeholds.--
            ``(1) Chokehold defined.--In this subsection, the term 
        `chokehold' means a physical maneuver that restricts an 
        individual's ability to breathe for the purposes of 
        incapacitation.
            ``(2) Limitation on eligibility for funds.--Beginning in 
        the first fiscal year beginning after the date of enactment of 
        the JUSTICE Act, a State or unit of local government may not 
        receive funds under this section for a fiscal year if, on the 
        day before the first day of the fiscal year, the State or unit 
        of local government does not have an agency-wide policy in 
        place for each law enforcement agency of the State or unit of 
        local government that prohibits the use of chokeholds except 
        when deadly force is authorized.''.
            (2) Byrne grant program eligibility.--Section 501 of title 
        I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 
        U.S.C. 10152), as amended by section 102 of this Act, is 
        amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(j) Banning of Chokeholds.--
            ``(1) Chokehold defined.--In this subsection, the term 
        `chokehold' means a physical maneuver that restricts an 
        individual's ability to breathe for the purposes of 
        incapacitation.
            ``(2) Limitation on eligibility for funds.--Beginning in 
        the first fiscal year beginning after the date of enactment of 
        the JUSTICE Act, a State or unit of local government may not 
        receive funds under this part for a fiscal year if, on the day 
        before the first day of the fiscal year, the State or unit of 
        local government does not have an agency-wide policy in place 
        for each law enforcement agency of the State or unit of local 
        government that prohibits the use of chokeholds except when 
        deadly force is authorized.''.
    (c) Federal Law Enforcement Agencies.--
            (1) Definition.--In this subsection, the term ``chokehold'' 
        means a physical maneuver that restricts an individual's 
        ability to breathe for the purposes of incapacitation.
            (2) Federal policy.--The Attorney General shall develop a 
        policy for Federal law enforcement agencies that bans the use 
        of chokeholds except when deadly force is authorized.
            (3) Requirement.--The head of each Federal law enforcement 
        agency shall implement the policy developed under paragraph 
        (2).

SEC. 106. FALSIFYING POLICE INCIDENT REPORTS.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) when a law enforcement officer commits an offense that 
        deprives a citizen of their rights, privileges, and immunities 
        protected under the Constitution and laws of the United States, 
        that behavior is penalized to punish those involved and to 
        deter future conduct;
            (2) where serious bodily injury or death results from the 
        acts described in paragraph (1), punishment must be severe;
            (3) a law enforcement officer who intentionally submits a 
        false police report in connection with an act described in 
        paragraph (1) should also be punished severely;
            (4) false reporting described in paragraph (3) not only 
        serves to conceal potential criminal conduct and obstruct the 
        administration of justice, false reporting also undermines the 
        trust and confidence that communities place in law enforcement 
        agencies;
            (5) obstruction of justice is intolerable in any form, 
        particularly in the form described in this subsection;
            (6) the deterioration of trust and confidence between law 
        enforcement agencies and communities must be abated; and
            (7) severe penalties must be imposed for individuals who 
        create false police reports in connection with criminal civil 
        rights violations resulting in serious bodily injury or death.
    (b) Offense.--Chapter 47 of title 18, United States Code, is 
amended by adding at the end the following:

``SEC. 1041. FALSE REPORTING.

    ``(a) Offense.--It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly 
and willfully falsify a police report in a material way with the intent 
to falsify, conceal, or cover up a material fact, in furtherance of the 
deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or 
protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States where death 
or serious bodily injury (as defined in section 1365) occurs.
    ``(b) Penalty.--Any person who violates subsection (a) shall be 
fined under this title, imprisoned for not more than 20 years, or 
both.''.
    (c) Technical and Conforming Amendment.--The table of sections for 
chapter 47 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by inserting 
after the item relating to section 1040 the following:

``1041. False reporting.''.
    (d) Sentencing Enhancement for Falsification of Police Reports.--
Pursuant to its authority under section 994 of title 28, United States 
Code, the United States Sentencing Commission shall review and amend 
the Federal sentencing guidelines to ensure that the guidelines provide 
an additional penalty increase of not fewer than 4 offense levels if 
the defendant knowingly and willfully falsifies a report in a material 
way with the intent to falsify, conceal, or cover up a material fact, 
in furtherance of the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or 
immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the 
United States where death or serious bodily injury occurs.

                enforcement officer who intentionally fails to ensure 
                that a body-worn camera purchased using those funds is 
                engaged, functional, and properly secured at all times 
                during which the camera is required to be worn.
            (2) Other entities.--An entity other than a State that 
        receives funds under a covered provision shall have a policy in 
        place to apply discipline to any law enforcement officer who 
        intentionally fails to ensure that a body-worn camera purchased 
        using those funds is engaged, functional, and properly secured 
        at all times during which the camera is required to be worn.

               TITLE IV--JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF LYNCHING

SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Justice for Victims of Lynching 
Act of 2020''.

SEC. 402. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The crime of lynching succeeded slavery as the ultimate 
        expression of racism in the United States following 
        Reconstruction.
            (2) Lynching was a widely acknowledged practice in the 
        United States until the middle of the 20th century.
            (3) Lynching was a crime that occurred throughout the 
        United States, with documented incidents in all but 4 States.
            (4) At least 4,742 people, predominantly African Americans, 
        were reported lynched in the United States between 1882 and 
        1968.
            (5) Ninety-nine percent of all perpetrators of lynching 
        escaped from punishment by State or local officials.
            (6) Lynching prompted African Americans to form the 
        National Association for the Advancement of Colored People 
        (referred to in this section as the ``NAACP'') and prompted 
        members of B'nai B'rith to found the Anti-Defamation League.
            (7) Mr. Walter White, as a member of the NAACP and later as 
        the executive secretary of the NAACP from 1931 to 1955, 
        meticulously investigated lynchings in the United States and 
        worked tirelessly to end segregation and racialized terror.
            (8) Nearly 200 anti-lynching bills were introduced in 
        Congress during the first half of the 20th century.
            (9) Between 1890 and 1952, 7 Presidents petitioned Congress 
        to end lynching.
            (10) Between 1920 and 1940, the House of Representatives 
        passed 3 strong anti-lynching measures.
            (11) Protection against lynching was the minimum and most 
        basic of Federal responsibilities, and the Senate considered 
        but failed to enact anti-lynching legislation despite repeated 
        requests by civil rights groups, Presidents, and the House of 
        Representatives to do so.
            (12) The publication of ``Without Sanctuary: Lynching 
        Photography in America'' helped bring greater awareness and 
        proper recognition of the victims of lynching.
            (13) Only by coming to terms with history can the United 
        States effectively champion human rights abroad.
            (14) An apology offered in the spirit of true repentance 
        moves the United States toward reconciliation and may become 
        central to a new understanding, on which improved racial 
        relations can be forged.
            (15) Having concluded that a reckoning with our own history 
        is the only way the country can effectively champion human 
        rights abroad, 90 Members of the United States Senate agreed to 
        Senate Resolution 39, 109th Congress, on June 13, 2005, to 
        apologize to the victims of lynching and the descendants of 
        those victims for the failure of the Senate to enact anti-
        lynching legislation.
            (16) The National Memorial for Peace and Justice, which 
        opened to the public in Montgomery, Alabama, on April 26, 2018, 
        is the Nation's first memorial dedicated to the legacy of 
        enslaved Black people, people terrorized by lynching, African 
        Americans humiliated by racial segregation and Jim Crow, and 
        people of color burdened with contemporary presumptions of 
        guilt and police violence.
            (17) Notwithstanding the Senate's apology and the 
        heightened awareness and education about the Nation's legacy 
        with lynching, it is wholly necessary and appropriate for the 
        Congress to enact legislation, after 100 years of unsuccessful 
        legislative efforts, finally to make lynching a Federal crime.
            (18) Further, it is the sense of Congress that criminal 
        action by a group increases the likelihood that the criminal 
        object of that group will be successfully attained and 
        decreases the probability that the individuals involved will 
        depart from their path of criminality. Therefore, it is 
        appropriate to specify criminal penalties for the crime of 
        lynching, or any attempt or conspiracy to commit lynching.
            (19) The United States Senate agreed to unanimously Senate 
        Resolution 118, 115th Congress, on April 5, 2017, 
        ``[c]ondemning hate crime and any other form of racism, 
        religious or ethnic bias, discrimination, incitement to 
        violence, or animus targeting a minority in the United States'' 
        and taking notice specifically of Federal Bureau of 
        Investigation statistics demonstrating that ``among single-bias 
        hate crime incidents in the United States, 59.2 percent of 
        victims were targeted due to racial, ethnic, or ancestral bias, 
        and among those victims, 52.2 percent were victims of crimes 
        motivated by the offenders' anti-Black or anti-African American 
        bias''.
            (20) On September 14, 2017, President Donald J. Trump 
        signed into law Senate Joint Resolution 49 (Public Law 115-58; 
        131 Stat. 1149), wherein Congress ``condemn[ed] the racist 
        violence and domestic terrorist attack that took place between 
        August 11 and August 12, 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia'' 
        and ``urg[ed] the President and his administration to speak out 
        against hate groups that espouse racism, extremism, xenophobia, 
        anti-Semitism, and White supremacy; and use all resources 
        available to the President and the President's Cabinet to 
        address the growing prevalence of those hate groups in the 
        United States''.
            (21) Senate Joint Resolution 49 (Public Law 115-58; 131 
        Stat. 1149) specifically took notice of ``hundreds of torch-
        bearing White nationalists, White supremacists, Klansmen, and 
        neo-Nazis [who] chanted racist, anti-Semitic, and anti-
        immigrant slogans and violently engaged with counter-
        demonstrators on and around the grounds of the University of 
        Virginia in Charlottesville'' and that these groups 
        ``reportedly are organizing similar events in other cities in 
        the United States and communities everywhere are concerned 
        about the growing and open display of hate and violence being 
        perpetrated by those groups''.
            (22) Lynching was a pernicious and pervasive tool that was 
        used to interfere with multiple aspects of life--including the 
        exercise of Federally protected rights, as enumerated in 
        section 245 of title 18, United States Code, housing rights, as 
        enumerated in section 901 of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (42 
        U.S.C. 3631), and the free exercise of religion, as enumerated 
        in section 247 of title 18, United States Code. Interference 
        with these rights was often effectuated by multiple offenders 
        and groups, rather than isolated individuals. Therefore, 
        prohibiting conspiracies to violate each of these rights 
        recognizes the history of lynching in the United States and 
        serves to prohibit its use in the future.

SEC. 403. LYNCHING.

    (a) Offense.--Chapter 13 of title 18, United States Code, is 
amended by adding at the end the following:
``Sec. 250. Lynching
    ``Whoever conspires with another person to violate section 245, 
247, or 249 of this title or section 901 of the Civil Rights Act of 
1968 (42 U.S.C. 3631) shall be punished in the same manner as a 
completed violation of such section, except that if the maximum term of 
imprisonment for such completed violation is less than 10 years, the 
person may be imprisoned for not more than 10 years.''.

        enforcement agencies, including rank and file officers, civil 
        rights organizations, community-based organization leaders,
