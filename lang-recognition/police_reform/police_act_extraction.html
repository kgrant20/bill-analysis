/* This file is a compatability layer.  It allows the usage of flexible box 
model layouts accross multiple browsers, including older browsers.  The newest,
universal implementation of the flexible box model is used when available (see
`Modern browsers` comments below).  Browsers that are known to implement this 
new spec completely include:

    Firefox 28.0+
    Chrome 29.0+
    Internet Explorer 11+ 
    Opera 17.0+

Browsers not listed, including Safari, are supported via the styling under the

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This title may be cited as the ``Justice for Victims of Lynching \nAct of 2020&#39;&#39;.\n\nSEC. 402. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The crime of lynching succeeded slavery as the ultimate \n        expression of racism in the United States following \n        Reconstruction.\n            (2) Lynching was a widely acknowledged practice in the \n        United States until the middle of the 20th century.\n            (3) Lynching was a crime that occurred throughout the \n        United States, with documented incidents in all but 4 States.\n            (4) At least 4,742 people, predominantly African Americans, \n        were reported lynched in the United States between 1882 and \n        1968.\n            (5) Ninety-nine percent of all perpetrators of lynching \n        escaped from punishment by State or local officials.\n            (6) Lynching prompted African Americans to form the \n        National Association for the Advancement of Colored People \n        (referred to in this section as the ``NAACP&#39;&#39;) and prompted \n        members of B&#39;nai B&#39;rith to found the Anti-Defamation League.\n            (7) Mr. Walter White, as a member of the NAACP and later as \n        the executive secretary of the NAACP from 1931 to 1955, \n        meticulously investigated lynchings in the United States and \n        worked tirelessly to end segregation and racialized terror.\n            (8) Nearly 200 anti-lynching bills were introduced in \n        Congress during the first half of the 20th century.\n            (9) Between 1890 and 1952, 7 Presidents petitioned Congress \n        to end lynching.\n            (10) Between 1920 and 1940, the House of Representatives \n        passed 3 strong anti-lynching measures.\n            (11) Protection against lynching was the minimum and most \n        basic of Federal responsibilities, and the Senate considered \n        but failed to enact anti-lynching legislation despite repeated \n        requests by civil rights groups, Presidents, and the House of \n        Representatives to do so.\n            (12) The publication of ``Without Sanctuary: Lynching \n        Photography in America&#39;&#39; helped bring greater awareness and \n        proper recognition of the victims of lynching.\n            (13) Only by coming to terms with history can the United \n        States effectively champion human rights abroad.\n            (14) An apology offered in the spirit of true repentance \n        moves the United States toward reconciliation and may become \n        central to a new understanding, on which improved racial \n        relations can be forged.\n            (15) Having concluded that a reckoning with our own history \n        is the only way the country can effectively champion human \n        rights abroad, 90 Members of the United States Senate agreed to \n        Senate Resolution 39, 109th Congress, on June 13, 2005, to \n        apologize to the victims of lynching and the descendants of \n        those victims for the failure of the Senate to enact anti-\n        lynching legislation.\n            (16) The National Memorial for Peace and Justice, which \n        opened to the public in Montgomery, Alabama, on April 26, 2018, \n        is the Nation&#39;s first memorial dedicated to the legacy of \n        enslaved Black people, people terrorized by lynching, African \n        Americans humiliated by racial segregation and Jim Crow, and \n        people of color burdened with contemporary presumptions of \n        guilt and police violence.\n            (17) Notwithstanding the Senate&#39;s apology and the \n        heightened awareness and education about the Nation&#39;s legacy \n        with lynching, it is wholly necessary and appropriate for the \n        Congress to enact legislation, after 100 years of unsuccessful \n        legislative efforts, finally to make lynching a Federal crime.\n            (18) Further, it is the sense of Congress that criminal \n        action by a group increases the likelihood that the criminal \n        object of that group will be successfully attained and \n        decreases the probability that the individuals involved will \n        depart from their path of criminality. Therefore, it is \n        appropriate to specify criminal penalties for the crime of \n        lynching, or any attempt or conspiracy to commit lynching.\n            (19) The United States Senate agreed to unanimously Senate \n        Resolution 118, 115th Congress, on April 5, 2017, \n        ``[c]ondemning hate crime and any other form of racism, \n        religious or ethnic bias, discrimination, incitement to \n        violence, or animus targeting a minority in the United States&#39;&#39; \n        and taking notice specifically of Federal Bureau of \n        Investigation statistics demonstrating that ``among single-bias \n        hate crime incidents in the United States, 59.2 percent of \n        victims were targeted due to racial, ethnic, or ancestral bias, \n        and among those victims, 52.2 percent were victims of crimes \n        motivated by the offenders&#39; anti-Black or anti-African American \n        bias&#39;&#39;.\n            (20) On September 14, 2017, President Donald J. Trump \n        signed into law Senate Joint Resolution 49 (Public Law 115-58; \n        131 Stat. 1149), wherein Congress ``condemn[ed] the racist \n        violence and domestic terrorist attack that took place between \n        August 11 and August 12, 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia&#39;&#39; \n        and ``urg[ed] the President and his administration to speak out \n        against hate groups that espouse racism, extremism, xenophobia, \n        anti-Semitism, and White supremacy; and use all resources \n        available to the President and the President&#39;s Cabinet to \n        address the growing prevalence of those hate groups in the \n        United States&#39;&#39;.\n            (21) Senate Joint Resolution 49 (Public Law 115-58; 131 \n        Stat. 1149) specifically took notice of ``hundreds of torch-\n        bearing White nationalists, White supremacists, Klansmen, and \n        neo-Nazis [who] chanted racist, anti-Semitic, and anti-\n        immigrant slogans and violently engaged with counter-\n        demonstrators on and around the grounds of the University of \n        Virginia in Charlottesville&#39;&#39; and that these groups \n        ``reportedly are organizing similar events in other cities in \n        the United States and communities everywhere are concerned \n        about the growing and open display of hate and violence being \n        perpetrated by those groups&#39;&#39;.\n            (22) Lynching was a pernicious and pervasive tool that was \n        used to interfere with multiple aspects of life--including the \n        exercise of Federally protected rights, as enumerated in \n        section 245 of title 18, United States Code, housing rights, as \n        enumerated in section 901 of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (42 \n        U.S.C. 3631), and the free exercise of religion, as enumerated \n        in section 247 of title 18, United States Code. Interference \n        with these rights was often effectuated by multiple offenders \n        and groups, rather than isolated individuals. Therefore, \n        prohibiting conspiracies to violate each of these rights \n        recognizes the history of lynching in the United States and \n        serves to prohibit its use in the future.\n\nSEC. 403. LYNCHING.\n\n    (a) Offense.--Chapter 13 of title 18, United States Code, is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n``Sec. 250. Lynching\n    ``Whoever conspires with another person to violate section 245, \n247, or 249 of this title or section 901 of the Civil Rights Act of \n1968 (42 U.S.C. 3631) shall be punished in the same manner as a \ncompleted violation of such section, except that if the maximum term of \nimprisonment for such completed violation is less than 10 years, the \nperson may be imprisoned for not more than 10 years.&#39;&#39;.\n    (b) Table of Sections Amendment.--The table of sections for chapter \n13 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by inserting after the \nitem relating to section 249 the following:\n\n``250.

are transferred to Federal, \n        Tribal, State, and local law enforcement agencies through the \n        program.\n            (3) As a result local law enforcement agencies, including \n        police and sheriff&#39;s departments, are acquiring this material \n        for use in their normal operations.\n            (4) As a result of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, \n        military equipment purchased for, and used in, those wars has \n        become excess property and has been made available for transfer \n        to local and Federal law enforcement agencies.\n            (5) In Fiscal Year 2017, $504,000,000 worth of property was \n        transferred to law enforcement agencies.\n            (6) More than $6,800,000,000 worth of weapons and equipment \n        have been transferred to police organizations in all 50 States \n        and four territories through the program.\n            (7) In May 2012, the Defense Logistics Agency instituted a \n        moratorium on weapons transfers through the program after \n        reports of missing equipment and inappropriate weapons \n        transfers.\n            (8) Though the moratorium was widely publicized, it was \n        lifted in October 2013 without adequate safeguards.\n            (9) On January 16, 2015, President Barack Obama issued \n        Executive Order 13688 to better coordinate and regulate the \n        federal transfer of military weapons and equipment to State, \n        local, and Tribal law enforcement agencies.\n            (10) In July, 2017, the Government Accountability Office \n        reported that the program&#39;s internal controls were inadequate \n        to prevent fraudulent applicants&#39; access to the program.\n            (11) On August, 28, 2017, President Donald Trump rescinded \n        Executive Order 13688 despite a July 2017 Government \n        Accountability Office report finding deficiencies with the \n        administration of the 1033 program.\n            (12) As a result, Federal, State, and local law enforcement \n        departments across the country are eligible again to acquire \n        free ``military-grade&#39;&#39; weapons and equipment that could be \n        used inappropriately during policing efforts in which people \n        and taxpayers could be harmed.\n            (13) The Department of Defense categorizes equipment \n        eligible for transfer under the 1033 program as ``controlled&#39;&#39; \n        and ``un-controlled&#39;&#39; equipment. ``Controlled equipment&#39;&#39; \n        includes weapons, explosives such as flash-bang grenades, mine-\n        resistant ambush-protected vehicles, long-range acoustic \n        devices, aircraft capable of being modified to carry armament \n        that are combat coded, and silencers, among other military \n        grade items.\n    (b) Limitation on Department of Defense Transfer of Personal \nProperty to Local Law Enforcement Agencies.--\n            (1) In general.--Section 2576a of title 10, United States \n        Code, is amended--\n                    (A) in subsection (a)--\n                            (i) in paragraph (1)(A), by striking \n                        ``counterdrug, counterterrorism, and border \n                        security activities&#39;&#39;

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The crime of lynching succeeded slavery as the ultimate \n        expression of racism in the United States following \n        Reconstruction.\n            (2) Lynching was a widely acknowledged practice in the \n        United States until the middle of the 20th century.\n            (3) Lynching was a crime that occurred throughout the \n        United States, with documented incidents in all but 4 States.\n            (4) At least 4,742 people, predominantly African Americans, \n        were reported lynched in the United States between 1882 and \n        1968.\n            (5) Ninety-nine percent of all perpetrators of lynching \n        escaped from punishment by State or local officials.\n            (6) Lynching prompted African Americans to form the \n        National Association for the Advancement of Colored People \n        (referred to in this section as the ``NAACP&#39;&#39;) and prompted \n        members of B&#39;nai B&#39;rith to found the Anti-Defamation League.\n            (7) Mr. Walter White, as a member of the NAACP and later as \n        the executive secretary of the NAACP from 1931 to 1955, \n        meticulously investigated lynchings in the United States and \n        worked tirelessly to end segregation and racialized terror.\n            (8) Nearly 200 anti-lynching bills were introduced in \n        Congress during the first half of the 20th century.\n            (9) Between 1890 and 1952, 7 Presidents petitioned Congress \n        to end lynching.\n            (10) Between 1920 and 1940, the House of Representatives \n        passed 3 strong anti-lynching measures.\n            (11) Protection against lynching was the minimum and most \n        basic of Federal responsibilities, and the Senate considered \n        but failed to enact anti-lynching legislation despite repeated \n        requests by civil rights groups, Presidents, and the House of \n        Representatives to do so.\n            (12) The publication of ``Without Sanctuary: Lynching \n        Photography in America&#39;&#39; helped bring greater awareness and \n        proper recognition of the victims of lynching.\n            (13) Only by coming to terms with history can the United \n        States effectively champion human rights abroad.\n            (14) An apology offered in the spirit of true repentance \n        moves the United States toward reconciliation and may become \n        central to a new understanding, on which improved racial \n        relations can be forged.\n            (15) Having concluded that a reckoning with our own history \n        is the only way the country can effectively champion human \n        rights abroad, 90 Members of the United States Senate agreed to \n        Senate Resolution 39, 109th Congress, on June 13, 2005, to \n        apologize to the victims of lynching and the descendants of \n        those victims for the failure of the Senate to enact anti-\n        lynching legislation.\n            (16) The National Memorial for Peace and Justice, which \n        opened to the public in Montgomery, Alabama, on April 26, 2018, \n        is the Nation&#39;s first memorial dedicated to the legacy of \n        enslaved Black people, people terrorized by lynching, African \n        Americans humiliated by racial segregation and Jim Crow, and \n        people of color burdened with contemporary presumptions of \n        guilt and police violence.\n            (17) Notwithstanding the Senate&#39;s apology and the \n        heightened awareness and education about the Nation&#39;s legacy \n        with lynching, it is wholly necessary and appropriate for the \n        Congress to enact legislation, after 100 years of unsuccessful \n        legislative efforts, finally to make lynching a Federal crime.\n            (18) Further, it is the sense of Congress that criminal \n        action by a group increases the likelihood that the criminal \n        object of that group will be successfully attained and \n        decreases the probability that the individuals involved will \n        depart from their path of criminality. Therefore, it is \n        appropriate to specify criminal penalties for the crime of \n        lynching, or any attempt or conspiracy to commit lynching.\n            (19) The United States Senate agreed to unanimously Senate \n        Resolution 118, 115th Congress, on April 5, 2017, \n        ``[c]ondemning hate crime and any other form of racism, \n        religious or ethnic bias, discrimination, incitement to \n        violence, or animus targeting a minority in the United States&#39;&#39; \n        and taking notice specifically of Federal Bureau of \n        Investigation statistics demonstrating that ``among single-bias \n        hate crime incidents in the United States, 59.2 percent of \n        victims were targeted due to racial, ethnic, or ancestral bias, \n        and among those victims, 52.2 percent were victims of crimes \n        motivated by the offenders&#39; anti-Black or anti-African American \n        bias&#39;&#39;.\n            (20) On September 14, 2017, President Donald J. Trump \n        signed into law Senate Joint Resolution 49 (Public Law 115-58; \n        131 Stat. 1149), wherein Congress ``condemn[ed] the racist \n        violence and domestic terrorist attack that took place between \n        August 11 and August 12, 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia&#39;&#39; \n        and ``urg[ed] the President and his administration to speak out \n        against hate groups that espouse racism, extremism, xenophobia, \n        anti-Semitism, and White supremacy; and use all resources \n        available to the President and the President&#39;s Cabinet to \n        address the growing prevalence of those hate groups in the \n        United States&#39;&#39;.\n            (21) Senate Joint Resolution 49 (Public Law 115-58; 131 \n        Stat. 1149) specifically took notice of ``hundreds of torch-\n        bearing White nationalists, White supremacists, Klansmen, and \n        neo-Nazis [who] chanted racist, anti-Semitic, and anti-\n        immigrant slogans and violently engaged with counter-\n        demonstrators on and around the grounds of the University of \n        Virginia in Charlottesville&#39;&#39; and that these groups \n        ``reportedly are organizing similar events in other cities in \n        the United States and communities everywhere are concerned \n        about the growing and open display of hate and violence being \n        perpetrated by those groups&#39;&#39;.\n            (22) Lynching was a pernicious and pervasive tool that was \n        used to interfere with multiple aspects of life--including the \n        exercise of federally protected rights, as enumerated in \n        section 245 of title 18, United States Code, housing rights, as \n        enumerated in section 901 of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (42 \n        U.S.C. 3631), and the free exercise of religion, as enumerated \n        in section 247 of title 18, United States Code. Interference \n        with these rights was often effectuated by multiple offenders \n        and groups, rather than isolated individuals. Therefore, \n        prohibiting conspiracies to violate each of these rights \n        recognizes the history of lynching in the United States and \n        serves to prohibit its use in the future.\n\nSEC. 403. LYNCHING.\n\n    (a) Offense.--Chapter 13 of title 18, United States Code, is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n``Sec. 250. Lynching\n    ``Whoever conspires with another person to violate section 245, \n247, or 249 of this title or section 901 of the Civil Rights Act of \n1968 (42 U.S.C. 3631) shall be punished in the same manner as a \ncompleted violation of such section, except that if the maximum term of \nimprisonment for such completed violation is less than 10 years, the \nperson may be imprisoned for not more than 10 years.&#39;&#39;.\n    (b) Table of Sections Amendment.--The table of sections for chapter \n13 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by inserting after the \nitem relating to section 249 the following:\n\n``250. Lynching.&#39;&#39;.\n\n                   TITLE V--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n\nSEC. 501. SEVERABILITY.\n\n    If any provision of this Act, or the application of such a \nprovision to any person or circumstance, is held to be \nunconstitutional, the remainder of this Act and the application of the \nremaining provisions of this Act to any person or circumstance shall \nnot be affected thereby.\n\nSEC. 502. SAVINGS CLAUSE.\n\n    Nothing in this Act shall be construed--\n            (1) to limit legal or administrative remedies under section \n        1979 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (42 U.S.C. \n        1983), section 210401 of the Violent Crime Control and Law \n        Enforcement Act of 1994 (34 U.S.C. 12601), title I of the \n        Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. \n        10101 et seq.), or title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 \n        U.S.C. 2000d et seq.);\n            (2) to affect any Federal, State, or Tribal law that \n        applies to an Indian Tribe because of the political status of \n        the Tribe; or\n            (3) to waive the sovereign immunity of an Indian Tribe \n        without the consent of the Tribe.\n                                 &lt;all&gt;&#34;</pre>

Section 105. INCENTIVIZING BANNING OF CHOKEHOLDS. Sense of Congress. It is the sense of Congress that chokeholds are extremely dangerous maneuvers that can easily result in serious bodily injury or death. George Floyd\&#39;s death has become a flashpoint to compel the need to address the use of chokeholds by law enforcement officers across the United States. The National Consensus Policy on Use of Force, a collaborative effort among 11 of the most significant law enforcement leadership and labor organizations in the United States, concluded in a discussion paper on the use of force that chokeholds are extremely dangerous and recommended restricting their use, consistent with this section. And law enforcement agencies throughout the United States must create policies that guard against the use of this maneuver to help prevent the death of civilians whom they encounter, and engender more trust and faith among law enforcement officers and the communities they serve. Incentivizing Banning of Chokeholds. COPS grant program eligibility. Section 1701 of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 , as amended by section 601 of this Act, is amended by adding at the end the following: Banning of Chokeholds. Chokehold defined. In this subsection, the term `chokehold\&#39; means a physical maneuver that restricts an individual\&#39;s ability to breathe for the purposes of incapacitation. Limitation on eligibility for funds. Beginning in the first fiscal year beginning after the date of enactment of the JUSTICE Act, a State or unit of local government may not receive funds under this section for a fiscal year if, on the day before the first day of the fiscal year, the State or unit of local government does not have an agency-wide policy in place for each law enforcement agency of the State or unit of local government that prohibits the use of chokeholds except when deadly force is authorized.&#34;. Byrne grant program eligibility. Section 501 of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 , as amended by section 102 of this Act, is amended by adding at the end the following: Banning of Chokeholds. Chokehold defined. In this subsection, the term `chokehold\&#39; means a physical maneuver that restricts an individual\&#39;s ability to breathe for the purposes of incapacitation. Limitation on eligibility for funds. Beginning in the first fiscal year beginning after the date of enactment of the JUSTICE Act, a State or unit of local government may not receive funds under this part for a fiscal year if, on the day before the first day of the fiscal year, the State or unit of local government does not have an agency-wide policy in place for each law enforcement agency of the State or unit of local government that prohibits the use of chokeholds except when deadly force is authorized.&#34;. Federal Law Enforcement Agencies. Definition. In this subsection, the term &#34;chokehold&#34; means a physical maneuver that restricts an individual\&#39;s ability to breathe for the purposes of incapacitation. Federal policy. The Attorney General shall develop a policy for Federal law enforcement agencies that bans the use of chokeholds except when deadly force is authorized. Requirement. The head of each Federal law enforcement agency shall implement the policy developed under paragraph . Section 106. FALSIFYING POLICE INCIDENT REPORTS. Sense of Congress. It is the sense of Congress that when a law enforcement officer commits an offense that deprives a citizen of their rights, privileges, and immunities protected under the Constitution and laws of the United States, that behavior is penalized to punish those involved and to deter future conduct. Where serious bodily injury or death results from the acts described in paragraph (1), punishment must be severe. A law enforcement officer who intentionally submits a false police report in connection with an act described in paragraph (1) should also be punished severely. False reporting described in paragraph (3) not only serves to conceal potential criminal conduct and obstruct the administration of justice, false reporting also undermines the trust and confidence that communities place in law enforcement agencies. Obstruction of justice is intolerable in any form, particularly in the form described in this subsection. The deterioration of trust and confidence between law enforcement agencies and communities must be abated. And severe penalties must be imposed for individuals who create false police reports in connection with criminal civil rights violations resulting in serious bodily injury or death. Offense. Chapter 47 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following: &#34;Section 1041. FALSE REPORTING. Offense. It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly and willfully falsify a police report in a material way with the intent to falsify, conceal, or cover up a material fact, in furtherance of the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States where death or serious bodily injury occurs. Penalty. Any person who violates subsection (a) shall be fined under this title, imprisoned for not more than 20 years, or both.&#34;. Technical and Conforming Amendment. The table of sections for chapter 47 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by inserting after the item relating to section 1040 the following: &#34;1041. False reporting.&#34;. Sentencing Enhancement for Falsification of Police Reports. Pursuant to its authority under section 994 of title 28, United States Code, the United States Sentencing Commission shall review and amend the Federal sentencing guidelines to ensure that the guidelines provide an additional penalty increase of not fewer than 4 offense levels if the defendant knowingly and willfully falsifies a report in a material way with the intent to falsify, conceal, or cover up a material fact, in furtherance of the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States where death or serious bodily injury occurs. TITLE II BODY-WORN CAMERAS Section 201. BODY-WORN CAMERA PARTNERSHIP GRANT PROGRAM.

Definitions. In this section the term `covered government\&#39; means a State, unit of local government, or Indian Tribe. The term `Director\&#39; means the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance. And the term `unit of local government\&#39;, notwithstanding section 901, does not include an Indian Tribe. Authorization of Grants. The Director may make grants to eligible covered governments for use by the covered government for the purchase of body-worn cameras.

TITLE IV JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF LYNCHING Section 401. SHORT TITLE. This title may be cited as the &#34;Justice for Victims of Lynching Act of 2020&#34;. Section 402. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: The crime of lynching succeeded slavery as the ultimate expression of racism in the United States following Reconstruction. Lynching was a widely acknowledged practice in the United States until the middle of the 20th century. Lynching was a crime that occurred throughout the United States, with documented incidents in all but 4 States. At least 4,742 people, predominantly African Americans, were reported lynched in the United States between 1882 and 1968. Ninety-nine percent of all perpetrators of lynching escaped from punishment by State or local officials. Lynching prompted African Americans to form the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and prompted members of B\&#39;nai B\&#39;rith to found the Anti-Defamation League. Mr. Walter White, as a member of the NAACP and later as the executive secretary of the NAACP from 1931 to 1955, meticulously investigated lynchings in the United States and worked tirelessly to end segregation and racialized terror. Nearly 200 anti-lynching bills were introduced in Congress during the first half of the 20th century. Between 1890 and 1952, 7 Presidents petitioned Congress to end lynching. Between 1920 and 1940, the House of Representatives passed 3 strong anti-lynching measures. Protection against lynching was the minimum and most basic of Federal responsibilities, and the Senate considered but failed to enact anti-lynching legislation despite repeated requests by civil rights groups, Presidents, and the House of Representatives to do so. The publication of &#34;Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in America&#34; helped bring greater awareness and proper recognition of the victims of lynching. Only by coming to terms with history can the United States effectively champion human rights abroad. An apology offered in the spirit of true repentance moves the United States toward reconciliation and may become central to a new understanding, on which improved racial relations can be forged. Having concluded that a reckoning with our own history is the only way the country can effectively champion human rights abroad, 90 Members of the United States Senate agreed to Senate Resolution 39, 109th Congress, on June 13, 2005, to apologize to the victims of lynching and the descendants of those victims for the failure of the Senate to enact anti- lynching legislation. The National Memorial for Peace and Justice, which opened to the public in Montgomery, Alabama, on April 26, 2018, is the Nation\&#39;s first memorial dedicated to the legacy of enslaved Black people, people terrorized by lynching, African Americans humiliated by racial segregation and Jim Crow, and people of color burdened with contemporary presumptions of guilt and police violence. Notwithstanding the Senate\&#39;s apology and the heightened awareness and education about the Nation\&#39;s legacy with lynching, it is wholly necessary and appropriate for the Congress to enact legislation, after 100 years of unsuccessful legislative efforts, finally to make lynching a Federal crime. Further, it is the sense of Congress that criminal action by a group increases the likelihood that the criminal object of that group will be successfully attained and decreases the probability that the individuals involved will depart from their path of criminality. Therefore, it is appropriate to specify criminal penalties for the crime of lynching, or any attempt or conspiracy to commit lynching. The United States Senate agreed to unanimously Senate Resolution 118, 115th Congress, on April 5, 2017, &#34;condemning hate crime and any other form of racism, religious or ethnic bias, discrimination, incitement to violence, or animus targeting a minority in the United States&#34; and taking notice specifically of Federal Bureau of Investigation statistics demonstrating that &#34;among single-bias hate crime incidents in the United States, 59.2 percent of victims were targeted due to racial, ethnic, or ancestral bias, and among those victims, 52.2 percent were victims of crimes motivated by the offenders\&#39; anti-Black or anti-African American bias&#34;. On September 14, 2017, President Donald J. Trump signed into law Senate Joint Resolution 49 , wherein Congress &#34;condemned the racist violence and domestic terrorist attack that took place between August 11 and August 12, 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia&#34; and &#34;urged the President and his administration to speak out against hate groups that espouse racism, extremism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, and White supremacy. And use all resources available to the President and the President\&#39;s Cabinet to address the growing prevalence of those hate groups in the United States&#34;. Senate Joint Resolution 49 specifically took notice of &#34;hundreds of torch- bearing White nationalists, White supremacists, Klansmen, and neo-Nazis who chanted racist, anti-Semitic, and anti- immigrant slogans and violently engaged with counter- demonstrators on and around the grounds of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville&#34; and that these groups &#34;reportedly are organizing similar events in other cities in the United States and communities everywhere are concerned about the growing and open display of hate and violence being perpetrated by those groups&#34;. Lynching was a pernicious and pervasive tool that was used to interfere with multiple aspects of life including the exercise of Federally protected rights, as enumerated in section 245 of title 18, United States Code, housing rights, as enumerated in section 901 of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 , and the free exercise of religion, as enumerated in section 247 of title 18, United States Code. Interference with these rights was often effectuated by multiple offenders and groups, rather than isolated individuals. Therefore, prohibiting conspiracies to violate each of these rights recognizes the history of lynching in the United States and serves to prohibit its use in the future. Section 403. LYNCHING. Offense. Chapter 13 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following: &#34;Section 250. Lynching &#34;Whoever conspires with another person to violate section 245, 247, or 249 of this title or section 901 of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 shall be punished in the same manner as a completed violation of such section, except that if the maximum term of imprisonment for such completed violation is less than 10 years, the person may be imprisoned for not more than 10 years.&#34;. Table of Sections Amendment. The table of sections for chapter 13 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by inserting after the item relating to section 249 the following: &#34;250. Lynching.&#34;. TITLE V COMMISSION ON THE SOCIAL STATUS OF BLACK MEN AND BOYS ACT Section 501. SHORT TITLE.

Congress finds that it is in the interest of the United States to establish a commission to undertake a comprehensive review of the criminal justice system. There has not been a comprehensive study since the President\&#39;s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice was established in 1965. In a span of 18 months, the President\&#39;s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice produced a comprehensive report entitled &#34;The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society&#34;, which contained 200 specific recommendations on all aspects of the criminal justice system involving Federal, State, Tribal, and local governments, civic organizations, religious institutions, business groups, and individual citizens. And developments over the intervening 50 years require once again that Federal, State, Tribal, and local governments, law enforcement agencies, including rank and file officers, civil rights organizations, community-based organization leaders, civic organizations, religious institutions, business groups, and individual citizens come together to review evidence and consider how to improve the criminal justice system. Section 703. ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMISSION. There is established a commission to be known as the &#34;National Criminal Justice Commission&#34; . Section 704. PURPOSE OF THE COMMISSION.

Not later than 18 months after the date of the first meeting of the Commission, the Commission shall submit to the President and Congress recommendations for changes in Federal oversight, policies, practices, and laws designed to prevent, deter, and reduce crime and violence, reduce recidivism, improve cost-effectiveness, and ensure the interests of justice at every step of the criminal justice system. Unanimous consent. If a unanimous vote of the members of the Commission at a meeting where a quorum is present pursuant to section 706(d) approves a recommendation of the Commission, the Commission may adopt and submit the recommendation under paragraph (1). Public access. The recommendations submitted under this subsection shall be made available to the public. Report. In general. Not later than 18 months after the date of the first meeting of the Commission, the Commission shall disseminate to the Federal Government, as well as to State, local, and Tribal governments, a report that details the findings and supplemental guidance of the Commission regarding the criminal justice system at all levels of government.

If a majority vote of the members of the Commission approves a finding or supplemental guidance at a meeting where a quorum is present pursuant to section 706(d), the finding or supplemental guidance may be adopted and included in the report required under paragraph (1).

To the extent the review and recommendations required by this section relate to sentencing policies and practices for the Federal criminal justice system, the Commission shall conduct the review in consultation with the United States Sentencing Commission.

STOP MILITARIZING LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT. Findings. Congress makes the following findings: Under section 2576a of title 10, United States Code, the Department of Defense is authorized to provide excess property to local law enforcement agencies. The Defense Logistics Agency, administers such section by operating the Law Enforcement Support Office program. New and used material, including mine-resistant ambush- protected vehicles and weapons determined by the Department of Defense to be &#34;military grade&#34; are transferred to Federal, Tribal, State, and local law enforcement agencies through the program. As a result local law enforcement agencies, including police and sheriff\&#39;s departments, are acquiring this material for use in their normal operations. As a result of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, military equipment purchased for, and used in, those wars has become excess property and has been made available for transfer to local and Federal law enforcement agencies. In Fiscal Year 2017, $504,000,000 worth of property was transferred to law enforcement agencies. More than $6,800,000,000 worth of weapons and equipment have been transferred to police organizations in all 50 States and four territories through the program. In May 2012, the Defense Logistics Agency instituted a moratorium on weapons transfers through the program after reports of missing equipment and inappropriate weapons transfers. Though the moratorium was widely publicized, it was lifted in October 2013 without adequate safeguards. On January 16, 2015, President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13688 to better coordinate and regulate the federal transfer of military weapons and equipment to State, local, and Tribal law enforcement agencies. In July, 2017, the Government Accountability Office reported that the program\&#39;s internal controls were inadequate to prevent fraudulent applicants\&#39; access to the program. On August, 28, 2017, President Donald Trump rescinded Executive Order 13688 despite a July 2017 Government Accountability Office report finding deficiencies with the administration of the 1033 program. As a result, Federal, State, and local law enforcement departments across the country are eligible again to acquire free &#34;military-grade&#34; weapons and equipment that could be used inappropriately during policing efforts in which people and taxpayers could be harmed. The Department of Defense categorizes equipment eligible for transfer under the 1033 program as &#34;controlled&#34; and &#34;un-controlled&#34; equipment. &#34;Controlled equipment&#34; includes weapons, explosives such as flash-bang grenades, mine- resistant ambush-protected vehicles, long-range acoustic devices, aircraft capable of being modified to carry armament that are combat coded, and silencers, among other military grade items.

TITLE IV JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF LYNCHING ACT Section 401. SHORT TITLE. This title may be cited as the &#34;Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act&#34;. Section 402. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: The crime of lynching succeeded slavery as the ultimate expression of racism in the United States following Reconstruction. Lynching was a widely acknowledged practice in the United States until the middle of the 20th century. Lynching was a crime that occurred throughout the United States, with documented incidents in all but 4 States. At least 4,742 people, predominantly African Americans, were reported lynched in the United States between 1882 and 1968. Ninety-nine percent of all perpetrators of lynching escaped from punishment by State or local officials. Lynching prompted African Americans to form the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and prompted members of B\&#39;nai B\&#39;rith to found the Anti-Defamation League. Mr. Walter White, as a member of the NAACP and later as the executive secretary of the NAACP from 1931 to 1955, meticulously investigated lynchings in the United States and worked tirelessly to end segregation and racialized terror. Nearly 200 anti-lynching bills were introduced in Congress during the first half of the 20th century. Between 1890 and 1952, 7 Presidents petitioned Congress to end lynching. Between 1920 and 1940, the House of Representatives passed 3 strong anti-lynching measures. Protection against lynching was the minimum and most basic of Federal responsibilities, and the Senate considered but failed to enact anti-lynching legislation despite repeated requests by civil rights groups, Presidents, and the House of Representatives to do so. The publication of &#34;Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in America&#34; helped bring greater awareness and proper recognition of the victims of lynching. Only by coming to terms with history can the United States effectively champion human rights abroad. An apology offered in the spirit of true repentance moves the United States toward reconciliation and may become central to a new understanding, on which improved racial relations can be forged. Having concluded that a reckoning with our own history is the only way the country can effectively champion human rights abroad, 90 Members of the United States Senate agreed to Senate Resolution 39, 109th Congress, on June 13, 2005, to apologize to the victims of lynching and the descendants of those victims for the failure of the Senate to enact anti- lynching legislation. The National Memorial for Peace and Justice, which opened to the public in Montgomery, Alabama, on April 26, 2018, is the Nation\&#39;s first memorial dedicated to the legacy of enslaved Black people, people terrorized by lynching, African Americans humiliated by racial segregation and Jim Crow, and people of color burdened with contemporary presumptions of guilt and police violence. Notwithstanding the Senate\&#39;s apology and the heightened awareness and education about the Nation\&#39;s legacy with lynching, it is wholly necessary and appropriate for the Congress to enact legislation, after 100 years of unsuccessful legislative efforts, finally to make lynching a Federal crime. Further, it is the sense of Congress that criminal action by a group increases the likelihood that the criminal object of that group will be successfully attained and decreases the probability that the individuals involved will depart from their path of criminality. Therefore, it is appropriate to specify criminal penalties for the crime of lynching, or any attempt or conspiracy to commit lynching. The United States Senate agreed to unanimously Senate Resolution 118, 115th Congress, on April 5, 2017, &#34;condemning hate crime and any other form of racism, religious or ethnic bias, discrimination, incitement to violence, or animus targeting a minority in the United States&#34; and taking notice specifically of Federal Bureau of Investigation statistics demonstrating that &#34;among single-bias hate crime incidents in the United States, 59.2 percent of victims were targeted due to racial, ethnic, or ancestral bias, and among those victims, 52.2 percent were victims of crimes motivated by the offenders\&#39; anti-Black or anti-African American bias&#34;. On September 14, 2017, President Donald J. Trump signed into law Senate Joint Resolution 49 , wherein Congress &#34;condemned the racist violence and domestic terrorist attack that took place between August 11 and August 12, 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia&#34; and &#34;urged the President and his administration to speak out against hate groups that espouse racism, extremism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, and White supremacy. And use all resources available to the President and the President\&#39;s Cabinet to address the growing prevalence of those hate groups in the United States&#34;. Senate Joint Resolution 49 specifically took notice of &#34;hundreds of torch- bearing White nationalists, White supremacists, Klansmen, and neo-Nazis who chanted racist, anti-Semitic, and anti- immigrant slogans and violently engaged with counter- demonstrators on and around the grounds of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville&#34; and that these groups &#34;reportedly are organizing similar events in other cities in the United States and communities everywhere are concerned about the growing and open display of hate and violence being perpetrated by those groups&#34;. Lynching was a pernicious and pervasive tool that was used to interfere with multiple aspects of life including the exercise of federally protected rights, as enumerated in section 245 of title 18, United States Code, housing rights, as enumerated in section 901 of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 , and the free exercise of religion, as enumerated in section 247 of title 18, United States Code. Interference with these rights was often effectuated by multiple offenders and groups, rather than isolated individuals. Therefore, prohibiting conspiracies to violate each of these rights recognizes the history of lynching in the United States and serves to prohibit its use in the future. Section 403. LYNCHING. Offense. Chapter 13 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following: &#34;Section 250. Lynching &#34;Whoever conspires with another person to violate section 245, 247, or 249 of this title or section 901 of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 shall be punished in the same manner as a completed violation of such section, except that if the maximum term of imprisonment for such completed violation is less than 10 years, the person may be imprisoned for not more than 10 years.&#34;. Table of Sections Amendment. The table of sections for chapter 13 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by inserting after the item relating to section 249 the following: &#34;250. Lynching.&#34;. TITLE V MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS Section 501. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Act, or the application of such a provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be unconstitutional, the remainder of this Act and the application of the remaining provisions of this Act to any person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. Section 502. SAVINGS CLAUSE. Nothing in this Act shall be construed to limit legal or administrative remedies under section 1979 of the Revised Statutes of the United States , section 210401 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 , title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 , or title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. To affect any Federal, State, or Tribal law that applies to an Indian Tribe because of the political status of the Tribe. Or to waive the sovereign immunity of an Indian Tribe without the consent of the Tribe. all&#39;</pre>
